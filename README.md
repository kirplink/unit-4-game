OverWatch Characters and sounds made by Blizzard

This project is to showcase my ability to manipulate websites using JQuery.

Most elements on screen have been made using JQuery and the bulk of info is held in the characters array

The game is played by first selecting a fighter and then fighting against the three defenders one by one by hitting the attack button.

Your character's attack goes up the value of their base attack after every hit. Defender's attack value stays the same the entire game.

The game is won by defeating all the defenders and still having at least 1 hp left. If at any time you HP drops to 0 you will lose the game, even if your final blow took out the attacker.

Every character has different starting HP and Attack values, and you will have to carefully decide the order in which you face the defenders in order to come out victorious.

Have fun!
